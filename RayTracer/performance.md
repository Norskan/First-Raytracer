# Test Options:
- Dev:
	SSAA Active with 4 Samples
	128 soft shader samples

- Max:
	SSAA Active with 16 Samples
	256 soft shader samples

# Inital
Dev: 303  Seconds
Max: 2432 Seconds

# Multithread with 4 available cores
Dev: 201  Seconds 
Max: 1361 Seconds

faste but resulted in heavy shadow artifact

# Replace Random Number Generator with XOrShift
Dev: 66  Seconds
Max: 563 Seconds

heavy shadow artifact generated by moving to multithreading remained
the artifact where a result of the sharde state that was created when
allocation a buffer for the sampling data

# Get rid of cos and sin
Dev: 51  Seconds
Max: 410 Seconds

First thougt was to replace sinf and cosf with precalculated tables but actually
the entire calculation can be removed by introducing a table that contains points 
within a unit circle

After experimenting with the sample rate a sample rate of 516 increased the performance
to 51 seconds. Lower sample rates resulted in artifacts of the shadows under the spheres.
